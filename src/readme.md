# Calculate delta_hat

The key is to find the point r_n such that the bifurcation occurs. 

## Method 1: point of non-differentiability in the graph of standard deviation  

Means and standard deviations. 

When bifurcation occurs, the standard deviation of x is likely to change rapidly.

If we plot r versus standard deviation of x, we should see a sharp change at the bifurcation point (point of non differentiability).

## Box Counting

Just count the box (like a histogram).
